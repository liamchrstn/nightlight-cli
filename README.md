# Night Light CLI üåì

> Control Windows 10/11's Night Light feature programatically.

The binary format of the registry value was reverse engineered from
[`NightLight.cs`](https://github.com/Maclay74/tiny-screen/blob/eb829186159309f01b31fe6d4d5201b5e63e07bd/TinyScreen/Src/Services/NightLight.cs)
in the [`tiny-screen`](https://github.com/Maclay74/tiny-screen) project
by [Maclay74](https://github.com/Maclay74), and converted to Typescript with
help from ChatGPT.

For changing the scheduled Night Light settings via a slightly different
registry key, see this post: <https://superuser.com/a/1209192>.
