# Night Light CLI üåì

> Control Windows 10/11's Night Light feature programmatically.

The binary format of the registry value was reverse engineered from
[`NightLight.cs`](https://github.com/Maclay74/tiny-screen/blob/eb829186159309f01b31fe6d4d5201b5e63e07bd/TinyScreen/Src/Services/NightLight.cs)
in the [`tiny-screen`](https://github.com/Maclay74/tiny-screen) project
by [Maclay74](https://github.com/Maclay74), and converted to Typescript with
help from ChatGPT.

For changing the scheduled Night Light settings via a slightly different
registry key, see this post: <https://superuser.com/a/1209192>.

## Compatibility

Windows Version | Status
--------------- | ----------
Windows 11 22H2 | ‚úÖ Tested
Windows 10 21H2 | ‚ùî Untested but should work

Please open an issue if you find that this package does not work on your version
of Windows.

## Contribution

Since this works by modifying a single registry key, it can be done in any
language. A few examples are implemented already.
